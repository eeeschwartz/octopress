Listen up! I'm talking about stuff that's really important! (jk/jk/lol)

A few months back I did a (only slightly embarrassing) talk at [Ignite Chicago](www.ignitechi.org/). I spoke about our lives and how we live the way we live. Ignite is a fast-paced 15 seconds-per-slide kind of talk, so I may have come close to breaking JFK's world record trying to fit so much info into 5 short minutes.

I'm revisiting this talk as I'm preparing for a longer-form presentation at [Snow*Mobile Conference](http://snow-mobile.org/) in Madison, WI. [In Business](http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/January-2013/SnowMobiling-in-Madtown-Mobile-development-conference-draws-interest-from-far-and-wide/) wrote a nice story about the conference, now I just have to finish writing my talk so I have enough words to fill my 30 minute time slot.

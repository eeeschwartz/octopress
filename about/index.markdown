[Schwartzography](https://www.facebook.com/Schwartzography) is powered by digital nomads [Smith](https://twitter.com/#!/smithschwartz) and [Erik](https://twitter.com/#!/eeeSchwartz) Schwartz, who have been circling the globe since October 2011. After selling most of their belongings and giving up their apartment in Chicago, they've been living a life of slow travel throughout the U.S. and abroad while working online, eating egg-bean and cracking wise.

[Smith Schwartz](https://twitter.com/#!/smithschwartz) is a freelance front-end developer, writer and speaker. She also authors the column, [Well-Designed Travel](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/authors/smith) at Apartment Therapy where she doles out advice on unique destinations around the world.

[Erik Schwartz](https://twitter.com/#!/eeeSchwartz) is a long-time developer/partner at Chicagoâ€™s [Table XI](http://www.tablexi.com/) and musician of the past, present, and future. He also took a bunch of classes at Second City so he can be something of a cut up.
